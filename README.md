# Basic RNA 3D structure comparison metrics used in RNA-Puzzles assessment. 
---
## Update 
An update of the RNA Assessment repo. 
This version, compared to the `local-updates`, is the version I used for another project. I modified the importation of different modules as this code will be in `lib/rna_assessment` folder. 
I just modify some lines that seemed to don't work, and I added different files that were all located in a `__init__` file. 
I added also a layer to separate and have a consistent way of using the different scores. 
The files created by MC-Annotate are stored in `/tmp` folder. 

## Installation - Docker 

I used this code as follows: 
```
mkdir lib 
git clone https://github.com/clementbernardd/RNA_assessment.git --branch=scoring-version lib/rna_assessment
```
