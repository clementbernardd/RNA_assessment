# Basic RNA 3D structure comparison metrics used in RNA-Puzzles assessment. 
---
## Update 
An update of the RNA Assessment repo. 
I just modify some lines that seemed to don't work, and I added different files that were all located in a `__init__` file. 
I added also a layer to separate and have a consistent way of using the different scores. 

## Installation - Docker 

To run the `example.py` file with Docker, you can use: 

```
docker build -t rna_assessment .
docker run rna_assessment
```



## Previous README
This git includes:  

* an RNA structure normalization tool used in RNA-Puzzles.
* the RNA 3D structure comparison metrics used in RNA-Puzzles assessment, including RMSD (all atom), P value, Interaction Network Fidelity and Deformation Index. 

## Installation
To install the package:    
`git clone https://github.com/RNA-Puzzles/RNA_assessment.git`    
`cd RNA_assessment`    
`python setup.py install`    


## Dependency
This package depends on `biopython`.     
To install: `pip install biopython`   

If need to calculate the Interaction Network Fidelity, it needs to call [`MC-annotate`](https://major.iric.ca/MajorLabEn/MC-Tools.html).    
Please download the binary excution from the website and coordinate the directory for it at the top line `MCAnnotate_bin=` of the mcannotate.py script.    

 

## how to use
A detailed introduction can be found in the example [notebook](https://github.com/RNA-Puzzles/RNA_assessment/blob/master/example.ipynb) or the example [script](https://github.com/RNA-Puzzles/RNA_assessment/blob/master/example/example.py).
